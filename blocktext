Name:        Michael Zhao (michaelzhao314@gmail.com)
Date:        3/20/2020
Instructor:  Mark Keathly
Description: This project is a simulation of a real system used to schedule drivers
             and passengers using a transaction-based class system. The system can
             create schedules, manage rides, and automatically checks for requirements
             before allocating drivers to passengers. Additionally, it has a save and
             load system as well as input checking.
